# Preparation for Testing Tasks
### Preface

- This lesson is based on the Angular Workshop.
- If you are attending another Angular Workshop than this, we recommend to clone the Angular Testing Project to **get the best experience** dealing with the tasks.
- You get the source code by running...

```
git clone https://github.com/martinakraus/angular-testing --branch main
cd angular-testing
npm i
```

### Execute Tests

- Finally, execute `ng test` and have a look at the test results

Now, you are ready to go.
